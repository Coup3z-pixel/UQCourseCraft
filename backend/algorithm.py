In this file, we are implementing the timetabling algorithm for UQCourseCraft.

Inputs to algorithm:
User Data: A dictionary mapping days of the week to a list of time slots, indexable by military time (arr[0] represents 00:00-00:59).
Course Data: A dictionary mapping course codes to a list of class types, each containing a list of time slots.

Output: A dictionary mapping the course code and class type to the ideal preferences.
