In this file, we are implementing the timetabling algorithm for UQCourseCraft.

Inputs to algorithm:
User Data: A dictionary mapping days of the week to a list of time slots, indexable by military time (arr[0] represents 00:00-00:59).
Course Data: A dictionary mapping course codes to a list of class types, each containing a list of time slots.

Output: A dictionary mapping the course code and class type to the ideal preferences.

    Solve the timetabling problem by finding the best fit for course classes into user preferences.
    
    Args:
        time_slots (dict): A dictionary mapping days of the week to a list of time slots. Each time slot is given a number between 0 and 3 inclusive.
        0 represents unavailable, 1 represents poor time, 2 represents good time, and 3 represents ideal time.
        course_data (dict): A dictionary mapping a tuple of course code and class type to a list of class types, each containing a list of time slots.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping course code and class type to the ideal preferences.
