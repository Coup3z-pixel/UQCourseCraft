Welcome to UQCourseCraft, the ultimate timetabling tool! ðŸ˜´âœ¨

Ever been 3 hours deep in mysinet trying to optimise your preferencing so you're not sitting in a UQ lab at 6pm on a Friday? We certainly have. UQCourseCraft is here to save your sanity (and maybe your GPA). Let our intelligent scheduling system generate your preferences for you based on your desired schedule. Customise the times and days of the week you would like to come to university and watch as your top preferences are generated in front of your eyes. 

What can you do here? Glad you asked:
- **Ranked Time Blocks:** Tell us when you'd like to be at uni, and when you'd rather be doing literally anything else.
- **Lecture Toggle:** If you're like me and don't go to any of your lectures, simply toggle them off and generate your preferences.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Our AI works harder than you do during finals. It'll find the absolute best timetable based on your preferences.

Coming Soon:
- **Increase success rate** Ever been handed a scuffed timetable because you tried to get the same prac as everyone else? Our system optimises this issue away, choosing your preferences to give you the highest probability of getting what you want.
- **Minimise the time and numbe of days at Uni** Because we know you would rather be at home.
- **Friend Alignment:** (Coming soon!) Because suffering through group projects is better with friends.

UQCourseCraft: For students who have spent way too much time trying to do this by themselves.
